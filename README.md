# MIT link Extractor
As an undergraduate computer science student, I am deeply grateful to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for providing high-quality lectures for everyone, free of charge. I believe that the [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) website is one of the most sensational resources for computer science students that could be used as a phenomenal reference which may grace or even remove the obstacles of learning.     
-  With an special thanks to those who've dedicated their lives serving the Knowledge
-  And those giga-chads at MIT who trying to continue this lovely website.(You Rock!:)

## How Does it work?    

Well, That's a simple Ipython project. you should fillout the cells in an appropriate manner.      

#### Copy the link

First, you should provide the homepage link of your arbitrary course @OCW.See the pics below:    
![link](https://github.com/rezasharifi82/MIT_link_Extractor/blob/main/1.png)    




  or This one: (I had named this kind of page as "homepage")    
  ![Homepage](https://github.com/rezasharifi82/MIT_link_Extractor/blob/main/2.png)  




  #### After that...?

  After you've copied that link, you should paste it in the first cell of ipynb file (``` link_to_course``` variable).    
  ![copy](https://github.com/rezasharifi82/MIT_link_Extractor/blob/main/3.png)  


  #### Bingo!     

  Now you can run all those cells properly and finally you'll have a dictionary:

#### Download and Zip:
You can also download and zip the video files by executing the last cells.

## Why Should we have this project?!
Truth be told , you dont need that kind of projects in a normal country with a normal internet connection. Unfortunately, In my country (Iran) we cant access the OCW website without vpn. and that's why i tended to extract all those links and gather them up within a file. after that, I provide them to an international host provider for Jupyter notebooks which is free to use. And finally, I've downloaded the zip file successfully. :)       

That's why I deeply need that kind of projects.

## Apology
I deeply don't know if this project is illegal or not. I've used this project in an educational manner (not a commercial one). So, I am totally sorry from anybody in MIT who thought that was not a good project.
