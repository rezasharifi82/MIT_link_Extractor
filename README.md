# MIT link Extractor
As an undergraduate computer science student, I am deeply grateful to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for providing high-quality lectures for everyone, free of charge. I believe that the [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) website is one of the most sensational resources for computer science students that could be used as a phenomenal reference which may grace or even remove the obstacles of learning.     
-  With an special thanks to those who've dedicated their lives serving the Knowledge
-  And those giga-chads at MIT who trying to continue this lovely website.(You Rock!:)
